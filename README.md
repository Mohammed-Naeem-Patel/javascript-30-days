# JavaScript 30 Days Practice Challenge

This repository documents my structured 30-day JavaScript learning journey, focused on building strong fundamentals, understanding real-world patterns, and developing hands-on projects.

## 📌 What I Learned
- JavaScript fundamentals (conditions, loops, functions)
- Arrays, objects, and logic building
- DOM manipulation & event handling
- Form validation & error handling
- Working with APIs using fetch and async/await
- Project planning and implementation
- Git & GitHub basics

## 🧠 Project Planning & Cleanup

On Day 20, I carefully planned my major projects (Weather Search App and Movie Search App).  
This planning established user flow, features, and error handling before coding.

On Day 22, I cleaned up the repository, improved structure, updated documentation, and made the repo more professional and recruiter-friendly.

## 🚀 Projects Built

### 🌦 Weather Search App (Main Project)
- Search weather by city name
- Uses OpenWeatherMap API
- Async/Await with proper error handling
- Input validation and clean DOM updates

### 🎬 Movie Search App (Practice Project)
- Search movies by title
- Uses OMDb API
- Displays movie details and poster
- Built as additional practice to reinforce API and async JavaScript concepts

## 🧹 Repository Cleanup & Organization (Day 22)
-I reviewed and cleaned the repository structure, improved commit clarity, and added documentation to make the project more readable and professional for others.


## 🛠 Technologies Used
- HTML
- JavaScript
- Git & GitHub
