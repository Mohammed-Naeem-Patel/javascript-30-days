# JavaScript 30 Days Practice Challenge

This repository documents my structured 30-day JavaScript learning journey, focused on building strong fundamentals, understanding real-world patterns, and developing hands-on projects.

## 📌 What I Learned
- JavaScript fundamentals (conditions, loops, functions)
- Arrays, objects, and logic building
- DOM manipulation & event handling
- Form validation & error handling
- Working with APIs using fetch and async/await
- Project planning and implementation
- Git & GitHub basics

## 🧠 Project Planning (Day 20)
Before building projects, I dedicated a full day to planning and architecture.  
During this phase, I:
- Selected a **main project** (Weather Search App) to build with full focus
- Identified a **secondary practice project** (Movie Search App) to reinforce the same concepts
- Defined user flow, features, possible errors, and JavaScript concepts in advance

This planning step helped me write cleaner code, avoid confusion, and build projects more confidently.

## 🚀 Projects Built

### 🌦 Weather Search App (Main Project)
- Search weather by city name
- Uses OpenWeatherMap API
- Async/Await with proper error handling
- Input validation and clean DOM updates

### 🎬 Movie Search App (Practice Project)
- Search movies by title
- Uses OMDb API
- Displays movie details and poster
- Built as additional practice to reinforce API and async JavaScript concepts

## 🧹 Repository Cleanup & Organization (Day 22)
-I reviewed and cleaned the repository structure, improved commit clarity, and added documentation to make the project more readable and professional for others.


## 🛠 Technologies Used
- HTML
- JavaScript
- Git & GitHub
